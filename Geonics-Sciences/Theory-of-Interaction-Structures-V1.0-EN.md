# Theory of Interaction Structures  
(Geonics-Sciences)

## 1. Scope and Position

This document defines the **Theory of Interaction Structures**,  
a foundational theoretical line within **Geonics-Sciences**.

The theory studies interaction **not as a process, channel, or effect**,  
but as a potential **ontological structure** that may or may not arise
when entities interact.

This theory does not depend on:
- goals,
- control,
- optimization,
- meaning,
- utility,
- or intention.

It establishes the **minimal conditions** under which interaction
is structurally non-empty.

---

## 2. Empty Interaction as the Default

**Interaction is structurally empty by default.**

Most interactions:
- leave no structure,
- leave no memory,
- leave no trace,
- and vanish without consequence.

Empty interaction is not failure.  
It is the **normal state of reality**.

---

## 3. Non-Empty Interaction

An interaction is **non-empty** if and only if:

> **A new structure arises as a result of the interaction,  
> even if only for an instant.**

The duration of existence is irrelevant.

- A structure may exist briefly and disappear.
- Persistence is not required.
- Stability is not required.
- Consequence is not required.

If a structure arose, the interaction was non-empty.

---

## 4. Structure Without Trace

A structure may arise and disappear **without leaving any trace**.

This is allowed and expected.

The existence of a structure does **not** imply:
- memory,
- modification of participants,
- field accumulation,
- geometric persistence.

Structure and trace are **logically independent**.

---

## 5. Trace as Memory

A **trace** exists if and only if **memory arises**.

Memory is defined minimally as:
> **irreversibility of the interaction event.**

Memory is not:
- energy,
- information,
- state change,
- awareness.

Memory may be:
- local or shared,
- short-lived or persistent,
- unobserved or unrecognized.

If memory exists, a trace exists.  
If memory does not exist, no trace exists — even if structure briefly did.

---

## 6. Shared Memory

Memory may be **shared**, meaning:

- it does not belong to any single participant,
- it exists *between* participants,
- it is not reducible to individual memory states.

Shared memory does **not** require:
- a shared goal,
- shared meaning,
- shared control,
- coordination,
- agreement.

Shared memory may exist purely as a structural fact.

---

## 7. Correct Interaction

A **correct interaction** is defined as:

> **An interaction whose structure is compatible with memory.**

Correctness is structural, not normative.

An interaction may be:
- non-empty but incorrect → structure arises but leaves no memory,
- correct → memory arises.

Correctness does not imply stability.

---

## 8. κ as the Condition of Retention

Memory may exist without persistence.

For memory to be **retained**, a further condition is required.

> **κ (kappa) is the condition that allows memory to be retained.**

κ is not:
- a goal,
- a control mechanism,
- an intention,
- a cause of memory.

κ indicates that the interaction structure:
- does not immediately self-destruct,
- does not internally negate its own memory,
- is compatible with continuation.

If κ = 0, memory may arise but cannot persist.  
If κ > 0, memory becomes retainable.

---

## 9. Origin of κ

κ arises **from the structure itself**.

Specifically:

> **κ appears when an interaction structure  
> contains no internal reason for its own destruction.**

No external enforcement is required.

- No control is needed.
- No goal is needed.
- No optimization is needed.

κ is a structural fact, not a functional one.

---

## 10. Minimal Structural Chain

The theory establishes the following minimal chain:

1. Empty interaction (default)
2. Non-empty interaction (structure arises)
3. Memory (trace may or may not arise)
4. Shared memory (possible)
5. κ > 0 (memory becomes retainable)

No step implies the next.
Each step requires independent conditions.

---

## 11. Boundary of the Theory

This theory **ends here**.

It does not address:
- growth of κ,
- amplification of memory,
- meaning,
- purpose,
- control,
- emergence of higher-order entities.

Any further questions belong to **other theories within Geonics-Sciences**.

---

## 12. Status

The Theory of Interaction Structures is **structurally complete**  
at the level defined in this document.

It is intended to:
- serve as a foundation,
- constrain future theories,
- prevent premature formalization.

Further development, if any, must occur at a higher theoretical level.
