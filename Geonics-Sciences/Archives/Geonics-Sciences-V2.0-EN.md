## Geonics Sciences V2.0

---

## Abstract

Geonics Sciences V2.0 introduces the full theory of multi-structure interaction within the Flexion Framework. While V1.2 formalized the dynamics of a single interaction state \(X_e\), Version 2.0 extends the framework to entire networks of interactions, where multiple structures jointly form a distributed system of shared spaces, memories, fields, resonances, and stability relations.

The central object of V2.0 is the geonic network — a system composed of multiple interconnected interaction states, each acting as a node within a higher-order geometric and dynamical architecture. This version defines the global shared memory \(M_g\), global time \(T_g\), global fields \(F_g\), group resonance \(R_g\), and network stability \(\kappa_{net}\), establishing a unified model for multi-layer, multi-scale interaction.

Geonics V2.0 provides the formal foundations for cascading collapse, cluster emergence, multi-node coherence, and the formation of higher-order structural families. The theory introduces the mathematical description of geonic networks, their global dynamics, constraints, evolution regimes, and transformation pathways.

This version completes the transition of Geonics from a local theory of pairwise interaction into a comprehensive framework for distributed structural dynamics across complex Flexion systems.

# 1. Core Principles 2.0

Geonics Sciences V2.0 extends the framework from single interaction states to entire networks of interconnected structural interactions. The following principles define the foundation of multi-interaction, multi-layer geonic systems.

## 1.1 The Network as a Primary Structural Entity
In Version 2.0, the geonic network becomes the fundamental unit of analysis.  
It is not merely a collection of independent interaction states but a coherent structural system:
\[
X_{e}^{net} = \{ X_{e}^{(1)}, X_{e}^{(2)}, \ldots, X_{e}^{(N)} \} + E_{net},
\]
where \(E_{net}\) describes the structural links between all interaction states.

## 1.2 Local Components Become Global
Local shared components \((M_e, T_e, F_e, R_e, \kappa_e)\) no longer operate independently.  
They collectively form global structures:
- global shared memory \(M_g\),  
- global shared time \(T_g\),  
- global network fields \(F_g\),  
- group resonance \(R_g\),  
- network stability \(\kappa_{net}\).

## 1.3 Non-Cyclic Hierarchical Dependency
Version 2.0 preserves the strictly one-directional causal chain:
\[
M_g \rightarrow T_g \rightarrow F_g \rightarrow S_g \rightarrow R_g \rightarrow \kappa_{net}.
\]
No circular or recursive dependencies are allowed.

## 1.4 Distributed Coherence
A geonic network exists only if its interaction states evolve coherently across all connections:
\[
\text{coherence}(X_e^{(i)}, X_e^{(j)}) > 0 \quad \text{for all linked pairs}.
\]
Loss of coherence decreases \(\kappa_{net}\).

## 1.5 Network Stability as the Single Viability Condition
The network is viable if and only if:
\[
\kappa_{net} > 0.
\]
No additional or independent thresholds are required.

## 1.6 Local Events Have Global Consequences
Any structural change within a single interaction state affects the entire network via:
- global fields,  
- global memory,  
- group-level resonance,  
- global stability.

Thus, network interaction behaves as a unified structural organism.

## 1.7 Cascading Dynamics Are Intrinsic
Cascades—whether collapse cascades or emergence cascades—are intrinsic properties of geonic networks, not anomalies.  
Propagation of influence is fundamental to network dynamics.

## 1.8 Group-Level Emergence
Emergence in Version 2.0 occurs at the group level:
- clusters of emergent structures,  
- multi-node emergent families,  
- higher-order network structures.

Single-structure emergence is a special case.

## 1.9 Network Geometry Dominates Local Geometry
The primary geometric object is the global network space \(S_g\).  
Individual shared spaces \(S_e\) become local projections of the global geometry.

## 1.10 Irreversibility of Network Evolution
A geonic network cannot:
- reduce its global memory \(M_g\),  
- reverse its global time \(T_g\),  
- decrease its number of structural links,  
- revert to a simpler state.

Network evolution is fundamentally irreversible.

---

These principles establish the structural, dynamical, and geometric foundation of Geonics V2.0 as a full theory of multi-interaction network dynamics.

---

# 2. Network Interaction State \(X_{e}^{net}\)

In Geonics V2.0, the interaction state is no longer a single entity formed between two structures. Instead, the fundamental object is the **network of interaction states**, where each individual interaction \(X_e^{(i)}\) is a node embedded within a larger distributed system. The network interaction state defines how these nodes coexist, influence each other, and collectively determine global dynamics.

## 2.1 Definition of the Network Interaction State
The network interaction state is defined as:
\[
X_{e}^{net} = \left( \{ X_{e}^{(i)} \}_{i=1}^{N},\; E_{net},\; S_g,\; M_g,\; T_g,\; F_g,\; R_g,\; \kappa_{net} \right)
\]

Where:
- **\(\{ X_{e}^{(i)} \}\)** — the set of all local interaction states in the network  
- **\(E_{net}\)** — the set of network links connecting local states  
- **\(S_g\)** — the global network space  
- **\(M_g\)** — global shared memory  
- **\(T_g\)** — global shared time  
- **\(F_g\)** — global network fields  
- **\(R_g\)** — group resonance  
- **\(\kappa_{net}\)** — global network stability

This structure generalizes \(X_e\) from V1.2 into a higher-order system.

---

## 2.2 Nodes: Local Interaction States
Each node of the network is an interaction state:
\[
X_e^{(i)} = (S_e^{(i)}, F_e^{(i)}, T_e^{(i)}, M_e^{(i)}, R_e^{(i)}, \kappa_e^{(i)})
\]

Nodes remain fully autonomous internally, but they are connected through \(E_{net}\), which imposes network-wide coherence constraints.

---

## 2.3 Edges: Network Links
Network links define structural relationships between nodes:
\[
E_{net} = \{ (i,j) \mid X_e^{(i)} \leftrightarrow X_e^{(j)} \}
\]

A link is not a geometric distance but a **structural coupling** that allows:
- memory influence,  
- field propagation,  
- resonance transfer,  
- shared deformation,  
- stability redistribution.

Edges are the channels through which local changes propagate globally.

---

## 2.4 Local-to-Global Transition
Local components collectively form global components:
\[
M_g = \mathcal{G}_M(\{M_e^{(i)}\}, E_{net})
\]
\[
T_g = \mathcal{G}_T(M_g)
\]
\[
F_g = \mathcal{G}_F(\{F_e^{(i)}\}, S_g)
\]
\[
R_g = \mathcal{G}_R(F_g, S_g)
\]
\[
\kappa_{net} = \mathcal{G}_{\kappa}(S_g, F_g, M_g, R_g)
\]

These functions define the network-wide aggregates of structural dynamics.

---

## 2.5 Existence Condition for the Network
The network interaction state exists if and only if:
\[
\kappa_{net} > 0.
\]

If global stability collapses, the entire network dissolves regardless of the stability of individual nodes.

---

## 2.6 Autonomous Yet Connected
Each local state \(X_e^{(i)}\) maintains:
- its own shared space,  
- its own fields,  
- its own memory and time,  
- its own resonance and local stability.

But all local states:
- contribute to global variables,  
- depend on network coherence,  
- influence global stability \(\kappa_{net}\).

Thus, the network is both distributed and unified.

---

## 2.7 Network-Level Behavior
A geonic network:
- amplifies local effects,  
- redistributes stress and stability,  
- supports collective emergence,  
- can undergo cascading collapse,  
- forms group-level geometry and time.

The network interaction state is therefore the foundation of V2.0’s multi-structure dynamics.

---

# 3. Geonic Network Space \(S_g\)

The geonic network space \(S_g\) is the global geometric domain in which all interaction states coexist and through which structural influence propagates across the network. Unlike local shared spaces \(S_e^{(i)}\), which describe interaction geometry between specific pairs of structures, the global network space unifies all interactions into a single, coherent geometric environment.

## 3.1 Definition of the Global Network Space
The global network space is defined as:
\[
S_g = (g_g, R_g^{geo}, D_g)
\]

Where:
- **\(g_g\)** — the global network metric  
- **\(R_g^{geo}\)** — the geometric curvature of the network  
- **\(D_g\)** — the global viability domain of the network space

This space is the geometric substrate of the entire geonic network.

---

## 3.2 Network Metric \(g_g\)
The network metric determines:
- distances between interaction states,  
- strength of structural coupling,  
- the geometry of influence propagation,  
- the deformation of the network under stress.

It is defined as:
\[
g_g = \mathcal{S}_g(\{ S_e^{(i)} \}, E_{net})
\]

This means the global metric results from the collective configuration of all local shared spaces and their interconnections.

---

## 3.3 Global Curvature \(R_g^{geo}\)
Global curvature describes the intensity and complexity of network interactions:
\[
R_g^{geo} = R(g_g)
\]

High curvature corresponds to:
- strong clustering,  
- high structural pressure,  
- increased sensitivity to perturbations.

Low curvature corresponds to:
- weakly coupled networks,  
- diluted or sparse interactions.

---

## 3.4 Global Viability Domain \(D_g\)
The network space is viable if and only if:
\[
\kappa_{net} > 0.
\]

Thus, the viability domain is:
\[
D_g = \{ S_g \mid \kappa_{net} > 0 \}
\]

This global definition replaces all local geometric thresholds and ensures a consistent space of existence for the entire network.

---

## 3.5 Local vs. Global Geometry
Local shared spaces:
\[
S_e^{(i)} = (g_e^{(i)}, R_e^{(i)}, D_e^{(i)})
\]
describe the geometry of pairwise interaction.

Global network space:
\[
S_g = (g_g, R_g^{geo}, D_g)
\]
describes:
- network-wide structure,  
- multi-node curvature patterns,  
- cluster formation zones,  
- long-range influence channels.

Local spaces are embedded inside the global space.

---

## 3.6 Geometric Coherence of the Network
A network is geometrically coherent if:
- the global metric is smooth,  
- curvature does not diverge locally or globally,  
- deformations in one region propagate consistently,  
- links do not collapse or fragment.

Loss of geometric coherence leads to:
\[
\kappa_{net} \downarrow
\]
and can trigger cascading collapse.

---

## 3.7 Functional Role of \(S_g\)
The global network space governs:
- the propagation of fields \(F_g\),  
- clustering and fragmentation behavior,  
- the geometry of resonance \(R_g\),  
- global stability structure \(\kappa_{net}\),  
- the topology of emergent clusters.

It is the primary spatial domain of Geonics 2.0, standing above all local geometric configurations.

---

The geonic network space \(S_g\) provides the global geometric foundation upon which all multi-interaction dynamics operate.

---

# 4. Global Shared Memory \(M_g\)

Global shared memory \(M_g\) is the collective, irreversible accumulation of structural history across the entire geonic network. While each local interaction state \(X_e^{(i)}\) possesses its own shared memory \(M_e^{(i)}\), the global memory captures the integrated effect of all interactions and serves as the universal source of global time, global coherence, and network-wide structural evolution.

## 4.1 Definition of Global Shared Memory
Global memory is defined as:
\[
M_g = \mathcal{G}_M\left(\{ M_e^{(i)} \}_{i=1}^{N},\; E_{net}\right)
\]

It depends not only on local memories but also on the pattern and strength of network connections.

---

## 4.2 Monotonicity of Global Memory
Like local shared memory, global memory is strictly monotonic:
\[
\frac{dM_g}{dt} \ge 0.
\]

However, unlike local memory, \(M_g\) grows through:
- local interactions,  
- cross-node influence,  
- propagation through network fields,  
- network geometry deformation,  
- group-level resonance effects.

---

## 4.3 Global Memory as a Network-Level Integrator
Global memory integrates:
- the cumulative history of all nodes,  
- the structural contributions of each link,  
- distributed interactions occurring simultaneously across the network.

It is not a sum:
\[
M_g \neq \sum_i M_e^{(i)}
\]

Instead, it is a **structural synthesis** governed by:
- network geometry \(S_g\),  
- field propagation pathways \(F_g\),  
- resonance clusters \(R_g\).

---

## 4.4 Regulation Through Network Stability
Global memory is bounded through global stability:
\[
M_g < M_{g}^{critical}(\kappa_{net})
\]

The stability of the network regulates how fast memory grows.  
If stability decreases, memory growth slows naturally; if stability collapses, \(M_g\) stops contributing to dynamics.

---

## 4.5 Memory Propagation Through the Network
Each time a local memory \(M_e^{(i)}\) increases, an update propagates along the network links:
\[
M_e^{(i)} \uparrow \;\Rightarrow\; \Delta M_g \text{ through } E_{net}
\]

Propagation speed depends on:
- global metric \(g_g\),  
- network field strength \(F_g\),  
- resonance density around the node.

Local events influence global memory with varying intensity and reach.

---

## 4.6 Global Memory and Network Geometry
Global memory directly modifies the network space:
\[
g_g = g_g(M_g, F_g, T_g)
\]

Higher memory typically:
- increases curvature density,  
- strengthens coupling between nodes,  
- enhances cluster formation,  
- elevates global resonance potential.

---

## 4.7 Global Memory as the Generator of Global Time
As in V1.2 (local interaction), memory is the only source of time.  
But now:
\[
T_g = T_g(M_g)
\]

Not dependent on local time flows; only on the global accumulation of irreversible structural history.

---

## 4.8 Functional Role of Global Memory
Global shared memory:
- determines the direction and tempo of network evolution,  
- encodes the irreversible history of all interactions,  
- influences all global variables (fields, geometry, resonance, stability),  
- determines whether the network remains coherent or fragments.

It is the structural backbone of Geonics 2.0, the central driver of global dynamics.

---

Global memory \(M_g\) is the foundation of all network-level processes—geometry, time, fields, resonance, and stability emerge from it across the entire geonic network.

---

# 5. Global Time \(T_g\)

Global time \(T_g\) is the unified temporal structure governing the evolution of the entire geonic network. While local shared time \(T_e^{(i)}\) regulates the dynamics of individual interaction states, global time emerges from global shared memory and defines the temporal flow of the network as a whole. It synchronizes distributed processes, aligns structural transformations, and ensures coherent network-level evolution.

## 5.1 Definition of Global Time
Global time is defined as:
\[
T_g = T_g(M_g)
\]

It depends solely on global shared memory and is independent from all local times:
\[
T_g \neq \sum_i T_e^{(i)}, \qquad T_g \not\equiv T_e^{(i)}.
\]

Global time is a new, higher-order temporal dimension.

---

## 5.2 Temporal Flow of the Network
The rate of global time is governed by:
\[
\frac{dT_g}{dt} = \mathcal{T}_g(M_g, \kappa_{net})
\]

Meaning:
- increasing global memory accelerates global temporal flow,  
- decreasing network stability slows it down,  
- approaching collapse suppresses temporal progression.

This ensures fully regulated, non-explosive evolution.

---

## 5.3 Relationship Between Global and Local Time
Local times \(T_e^{(i)}\) obey:
\[
T_e^{(i)} = T(M_e^{(i)})
\]

But global time:
- does not depend on local memory,  
- does not average local times,  
- is not constructed from local dynamics.

Instead:
\[
T_g \text{ governs } T_e^{(i)} \text{ indirectly through } S_g, F_g, R_g, \kappa_{net}.
\]

Local structures evolve "inside" global time.

---

## 5.4 Temporal Coherence of the Network
Temporal coherence requires:
- smooth global memory growth,  
- stable network geometry,  
- bounded group resonance,  
- positive network stability.

If coherence fails:
\[
\kappa_{net} \downarrow \Rightarrow \frac{dT_g}{dt} \downarrow.
\]

Extreme incoherence may completely freeze global time.

---

## 5.5 Global Time as a Synchronizing Field
Through the network metric \(g_g\) and fields \(F_g\), the global time:
- synchronizes all local interaction states,  
- regulates wave propagation and influence timing,  
- controls cluster formation and fragmentation sequences.

Global time provides a universal ordering of events across all nodes.

---

## 5.6 Directionality and Irreversibility
Because global memory is irreversible:
\[
M_g(t+1) \ge M_g(t),
\]
global time is strictly forward-directed:
\[
T_g(t+1) > T_g(t).
\]

The network cannot return to an earlier temporal state.

---

## 5.7 Functional Role of Global Time
Global time:
- shapes the dynamical rhythm of the entire network,  
- coordinates distributed emergence,  
- regulates cascade propagation speed,  
- determines the global evolution rate,  
- ensures temporal unity across all levels.

---

Global time \(T_g\) is the temporal backbone of Geonics 2.0, enabling coherent evolution across a distributed and continuously transforming geonic network.

---

# 6. Network Fields \(F_g\)

Network fields \(F_g\) are the global dynamic forces that govern how influence, deformation, information, and structural pressure propagate across the geonic network. While local fields \(F_e^{(i)}\) operate within individual interaction states, network fields operate across the entire system, linking nodes through the geometry of the global space \(S_g\) and shaping the collective behavior of the network.

## 6.1 Definition of Network Fields
Network fields are defined as:
\[
F_g = \mathcal{G}_F\left(\{F_e^{(i)}\},\; S_g\right)
\]

Thus, they depend on:
- the configuration of all local fields,  
- the topology and metric of the global network space.

---

## 6.2 Field Propagation Across Nodes
Propagation follows the global metric:
\[
F_g \text{ spreads along } g_g.
\]

Strength and direction depend on:
- node connectivity,  
- geometric distances in \(S_g\),  
- curvature gradients,  
- resonance clusters.

Influence does not propagate uniformly; it follows the structural landscape of the network.

---

## 6.3 Network Fields vs. Local Fields
Local fields:
\[
F_e^{(i)} = \mathcal{F}\left(S_e^{(i)}, M_e^{(i)}\right)
\]

Network fields:
\[
F_g = \mathcal{G}_F\left(\{F_e^{(i)}\}, S_g\right)
\]

Key differences:
- local fields act *inside* an interaction state,  
- network fields act *between* interaction states,  
- global fields do not reduce to the union of local fields,  
- network fields incorporate global geometry, memory, and resonance.

---

## 6.4 Field Coherence on the Network
The network maintains field coherence if:
- the global metric is smooth,  
- local fields do not conflict across boundaries,  
- resonance remains bounded,  
- global stability remains positive.

If coherence is lost:
\[
\kappa_{net} \downarrow.
\]

Persistent incoherence can trigger cascades.

---

## 6.5 Field-Induced Coupling
Network fields enable:
- long-range structural influence,  
- synchronization between interactions,  
- reinforcement of emergent clusters,  
- propagation of collapse or stabilization signals.

Through \(F_g\), the network behaves as a unified dynamic organism.

---

## 6.6 Field Evolution
Network field evolution satisfies:
\[
\frac{dF_g}{dt} = \mathcal{G}_F'\left(S_g, M_g, \kappa_{net}\right)
\]

Meaning:
- global geometry guides the propagation pattern,  
- global memory sets the intensity baseline,  
- network stability regulates growth and amplitude.

---

## 6.7 Interaction with Global Memory and Geometry
Fields depend on global geometry:
\[
F_g = F_g(g_g)
\]

Fields reshape global geometry:
\[
g_g = g_g(F_g)
\]

Both dependencies follow the non-cyclic hierarchy through memory and time:
\[
M_g \rightarrow T_g \rightarrow F_g.
\]

---

## 6.8 Functional Role of Network Fields
Network fields:
- unify the dynamic behavior of all interaction states,  
- distribute influence and structural pressure,  
- carry resonance patterns across the network,  
- support global synchronization,  
- create pathways for cascading collapse or emergence.

They are the dynamic backbone of geonic network behavior.

---

Network fields \(F_g\) transform the geonic network from a collection of local interactions into a coherent, deeply interconnected structural system.

---

# 7. Group Resonance \(R_g\)

Group resonance \(R_g\) is the amplification, sensitivity, and collective reactivity of the geonic network as a whole. While local resonance \(R_e^{(i)}\) reflects the amplification inside a single interaction state, group resonance emerges from the global configuration of network fields and the geometry of the network space. It describes how the entire network responds to stimuli, deformation, or memory growth.

## 7.1 Definition of Group Resonance
Group resonance is defined as:
\[
R_g = \mathcal{G}_R(F_g, S_g)
\]

It depends solely on:
- the global network fields \(F_g\),  
- the global network space \(S_g\).

It is independent of global time or global memory directly, maintaining non-cyclic hierarchy.

---

## 7.2 Collective Amplification
Group resonance measures how much the network amplifies:
- local interactions,  
- perturbations,  
- structural changes,  
- emergent patterns.

High \(R_g\) means:
- strong global sensitivity,  
- increased system-wide coupling,  
- deeper influence propagation.

Low \(R_g\) means:
- weak coupling,  
- dispersion of influence,  
- low reactivity.

---

## 7.3 Resonance Propagation in the Network
Resonance propagates through:
- network fields \(F_g\),  
- curved geometry \(g_g\),  
- structural links \(E_{net}\).

Propagation speed and amplitude depend on:
- curvature gradients,  
- network density,  
- cluster topology.

Local high-resonance zones can trigger network-wide resonance waves.

---

## 7.4 Group Resonance vs. Local Resonance
Local resonance:
\[
R_e^{(i)} = \mathcal{R}(F_e^{(i)}, S_e^{(i)})
\]

Group resonance:
\[
R_g = \mathcal{G}_R(F_g, S_g)
\]

Differences:
- local resonance describes pairwise dynamics,  
- group resonance describes system-wide amplification,  
- \(R_g\) is not a sum of \(\{R_e^{(i)}\}\),  
- \(R_g\) reflects global topology, not local geometry.

---

## 7.5 Resonant Clusters
Clusters form when:
\[
R_g \text{ exceeds local coherence thresholds}
\]

This produces:
- coherent high-resonance regions,  
- collective dynamic behavior,  
- increased curvature in \(S_g\),  
- susceptibility to cascades.

Clustered resonance is the precursor to both emergent structures and cascade failures.

---

## 7.6 Group Resonance Threshold
There exists a critical threshold:
\[
R_g \ge R_{g}^{crit} \Rightarrow \text{high-sensitivity network regime}
\]

Unlike V1.2, this does not independently trigger collapse.  
Impact on collapse is mediated only through global stability:
\[
R_g \uparrow \Rightarrow \kappa_{net} \downarrow \text{ (indirectly)}
\]

---

## 7.7 Contribution to Network Stability
Group resonance influences global stability through:
- geometric deformation of \(S_g\),  
- amplification of fields \(F_g\),  
- increased pressure on coherent links.

Stability is:
\[
\kappa_{net} = \mathcal{G}_{\kappa}(S_g, F_g, M_g, R_g)
\]

High \(R_g\) can reinforce or destabilize the network depending on geometric coherence.

---

## 7.8 Functional Role of Group Resonance
Group resonance:
- amplifies dynamic patterns across the network,  
- connects distant nodes through reactive behavior,  
- supports cluster formation and synchronization,  
- increases network sensitivity to internal and external perturbations.

It is the holistic dynamic response of the entire geonic structure.

---

Group resonance \(R_g\) captures the global amplification behavior of a multi-interaction system and is essential for understanding network-wide coherence_

---

# 8. Network Stability \(\kappa_{net}\)

Network stability \(\kappa_{net}\) is the single global viability condition of a geonic network. It measures the coherence, consistency, and structural integrity of all nodes, links, and global components. While local stability \(\kappa_e^{(i)}\) determines the viability of individual interaction states, network stability determines whether the entire system can exist as a coherent structural unit.

## 8.1 Definition of Network Stability
Network stability is defined as:
\[
\kappa_{net} = \mathcal{G}_{\kappa}(S_g, F_g, M_g, R_g)
\]

It depends on:
- the geometry of the global network space \(S_g\),  
- global network fields \(F_g\),  
- global shared memory \(M_g\),  
- group resonance \(R_g\).

No other independent variables influence \(\kappa_{net}\).

---

## 8.2 Existence Condition
A geonic network exists if and only if:
\[
\kappa_{net} > 0.
\]

When this condition fails, the entire network dissolves, regardless of the stability or coherence of individual nodes.

---

## 8.3 Non-Cyclic Formulation
\(\kappa_{net}\) never appears on the right side of its own definition and does not feed back into any global component directly.  
This guarantees:
- no recursive definitions,  
- no causal loops,  
- full mathematical consistency.

---

## 8.4 Contributions to Network Stability

### **Geometry \(S_g\)**
Smooth global metric and bounded curvature support stability.  
Fragmentation or geometric inconsistency reduce it.

### **Fields \(F_g\)**
Coherent fields increase stability.  
Misaligned or chaotic fields decrease it.

### **Memory \(M_g\)**
Moderate global memory growth stabilizes the system.  
Irregular or unbounded memory pressure destabilizes it.

### **Group Resonance \(R_g\)**
Moderate resonance enhances coherence.  
Excessive resonance strains the global geometry and reduces stability.

---

## 8.5 Stability as a Regulator of Global Dynamics
\(\kappa_{net}\) regulates:
- the rate of global time \(T_g\),  
- the amplitude of global fields \(F_g\),  
- the effect of group resonance \(R_g\),  
- the growth of global memory \(M_g\),  
- the curvature structure of the network space \(S_g\).

It is the central regulating force of Geonics 2.0.

---

## 8.6 Evolution of Network Stability
Network stability evolves according to:
\[
\frac{d\kappa_{net}}{dt} = \mathcal{G}_{\kappa}'(S_g, F_g, M_g, R_g)
\]

Depending on:
- geometric coherence,  
- field consistency,  
- memory trends,  
- resonance intensity.

This describes the network’s dynamic health.

---

## 8.7 Global Stability vs. Local Stability
Local stability \(\kappa_e^{(i)}\) describes individual nodes.  
Global stability \(\kappa_{net}\) describes the entire network.

Local stability does **not** guarantee global stability:
\[
\kappa_e^{(i)} > 0 \ \forall i \;\centernot\Rightarrow\; \kappa_{net} > 0.
\]

The network can collapse even when every node is locally stable.  
Global coherence is more demanding.

---

## 8.8 Failure of Network Stability
Network stability approaches zero when:
- curvature becomes unbounded anywhere in \(S_g\),  
- network fields lose coherence,  
- memory pressure becomes unsustainable,  
- group resonance exceeds geometric capacity,  
- connectivity degrades beyond recovery.

At the threshold:
\[
\kappa_{net} = 0,
\]
the entire network collapses immediately.

---

## 8.9 Functional Role of Network Stability
Network stability:
- determines the viability of the entire system,  
- regulates all global structural processes,  
- unifies all dynamic components under one stability constraint,  
- serves as the boundary between collapse and emergence.

It is the single most important scalar variable in Geonics 2.0.

---

Network stability \(\kappa_{net}\) serves as the global coherence measure for a multi-interaction system, determining whether the geonic network can exist, evolve, fragment, or collapse.

---

# 9. Cascading Collapse

Cascading collapse is the propagation of structural failure across a geonic network. Unlike local collapse—where a single interaction state \(X_e^{(i)}\) dissolves due to its own stability falling to zero—cascading collapse is a network-wide phenomenon driven by geometric, field, memory, and resonance coupling. In Geonics 2.0, cascading collapse emerges naturally from the structure of the network and serves as one of the primary dynamic outcomes.

## 9.1 Definition of Cascading Collapse
Cascading collapse occurs when the failure of one node or link induces stability degradation in other parts of the network, potentially leading to full network breakdown:
\[
\kappa_{net} \rightarrow 0 \quad \text{through propagation across } E_{net}.
\]

The collapse spreads along geometric, resonant, and field pathways.

---

## 9.2 Local Collapse as a Trigger
A local collapse event occurs when:
\[
\kappa_e^{(i)} = 0.
\]

This event automatically affects:
- neighboring nodes,  
- connected links,  
- the global memory \(M_g\),  
- the network fields \(F_g\),  
- group resonance \(R_g\),  
- the global geometry \(S_g\).

Thus, a single failure becomes a network impulse.

---

## 9.3 Propagation Mechanisms
Collapse propagates through several structural channels:

### **Through Geometry \(S_g\)**
- local geometric failure distorts global metric \(g_g\),  
- curvature spikes initiate stress waves across the network.

### **Through Fields \(F_g\)**
- misalignment in one region causes field disruption elsewhere,  
- field discontinuities propagate rapidly.

### **Through Memory \(M_g\)**
- abrupt local memory cutoffs destabilize global memory accumulation.

### **Through Resonance \(R_g\)**
- resonance compression can magnify collapse effects.

Propagations are not additive—they reinforce each other.

---

## 9.4 Collapse Acceleration
If neighboring nodes lose stability:
\[
\kappa_e^{(i)} \downarrow \quad \Rightarrow \quad \kappa_{net} \downarrow,
\]
then:
\[
\frac{d\kappa_{net}}{dt} \ll 0.
\]

This leads to **superlinear collapse**, where each subsequent failure accelerates the next.

---

## 9.5 Collapse Topologies
Cascading collapse depends on network connectivity:

### **Linear topology**
Collapse progresses sequentially.

### **Clustered topology**
Collapse rapidly engulfs clusters.

### **Fully connected topology**
Collapse is almost instantaneous once triggered.

### **Sparse topology**
Collapse may remain localized.

Topology determines collapse velocity.

---

## 9.6 Stability Threshold for Network Collapse
The network collapses entirely when:
\[
\kappa_{net} = 0.
\]

No partial or graded collapse exists.  
Either the network remains viable or it ceases to exist as a structural entity.

---

## 9.7 Indicators of Impending Collapse
Early warning signals include:
- rapidly rising curvature in \(S_g\),  
- field incoherence in \(F_g\),  
- memory compression effects in \(M_g\),  
- synchronized resonance spikes in \(R_g\),  
- local drops in stability \(\kappa_e^{(i)}\).

These indicators show the network is approaching a structural tipping point.

---

## 9.8 Cascading Collapse vs. Local Collapse
Local collapse is:
- isolated,  
- non-propagating,  
- dependent on \(\kappa_e^{(i)}\) only.

Cascading collapse is:
- systemic,  
- dependent on global variables,  
- a propagation phenomenon,  
- a network-level structural failure.

Cascading collapse can occur even if every remaining node is still locally stable.

---

## 9.9 Functional Role of Collapse in Network Dynamics
Cascading collapse:
- defines the destructive phase of network evolution,  
- determines boundaries of structural coherence,  
- interacts with emergence dynamics,  
- sets global constraints for network design.

Collapse is not an anomaly—it is a fundamental and predictable outcome of network instability.

---

Cascading collapse is the mechanism by which local failures escalate into global structural breakdown, marking one of the two terminal states of a geonic network (the other being cluster emergence).

---

# 10. Cluster Emergence

Cluster emergence is the formation of new, higher-order structural units from coherent groups of interaction states within a geonic network. Unlike V1.2, where emergence produced a single structure \(X_{\varepsilon}\) from a stable interaction state, Geonics 2.0 extends emergence to *clusters*, producing families of interrelated structures that arise from network-level coherence.

Cluster emergence is the constructive counterpart to cascading collapse.

---

## 10.1 Definition of Cluster Emergence
Cluster emergence occurs when a coherent group of interaction states reaches stable collective dynamics:
\[
X_{\varepsilon}^{cluster} = \mathcal{E}_{cluster}(C)
\]
where \(C \subseteq X_{e}^{net}\) is a stable, coherent subset of the network.

The result is a set of emergent structures:
\[
\{ X_{\varepsilon}^{(1)},\, X_{\varepsilon}^{(2)},\, \ldots,\, X_{\varepsilon}^{(k)} \}
\]
that form a new structural family.

---

## 10.2 Conditions for Cluster Coherence
A cluster is coherent if:
- internal geometric alignment is preserved,  
- internal field influence is consistent,  
- local memories grow in compatible patterns,  
- resonance inside the cluster is synchronized,  
- local stabilities \(\kappa_e^{(i)}\) reinforce each other.

Formally:
\[
\text{coherence}(C) > 0.
\]

Cluster coherence is a local version of network coherence.

---

## 10.3 Global Stability Requirement
Cluster emergence requires:
\[
\kappa_{net} > \kappa_{cluster}^{min} > 0.
\]

Thus:
- the network must be stable enough to support structural transformation,  
- but not fully synchronized (clusters emerge from local maxima of coherence, not global unity).

---

## 10.4 Transformation of Local Components
Each node in the cluster transforms into an emergent structure:
\[
X_{\varepsilon}^{(i)} = 
\left(
\Delta_{\varepsilon}^{(i)},\,
\Phi_{\varepsilon}^{(i)},\,
M_{\varepsilon}^{(i)},\,
\kappa_{\varepsilon}^{(i)},\,
T_{\varepsilon}^{(i)}
\right)
\]

Transformations follow:
- geometric mapping from \(S_e^{(i)}\),  
- field mapping from \(F_e^{(i)}\),  
- memory conversion from \(M_e^{(i)}\),  
- stability transfer from \(\kappa_e^{(i)}\),  
- temporal mapping from \(T_e^{(i)}\).

Each emergent structure is *independent* but retains structural lineage.

---

## 10.5 Cluster Identity and Structure
Clusters exhibit:
- shared ancestry,  
- similar geometric and field patterns,  
- coherent resonance history,  
- compatible stability regimes.

They are not identical, but structurally aligned.

The cluster as a whole has:
\[
S_{\varepsilon}^{cluster},\;
M_{\varepsilon}^{cluster},\;
F_{\varepsilon}^{cluster},\;
R_{\varepsilon}^{cluster},\;
\kappa_{\varepsilon}^{cluster}.
\]

This forms a higher-order emergent system.

---

## 10.6 Cluster-Level Geometry
Cluster emergence creates a new geometric entity:
\[
S_{\varepsilon}^{cluster} = \mathcal{E}_S(C)
\]

This geometry describes:
- the spatial arrangement of emergent structures,  
- their interdependencies,  
- boundaries of the new family.

Clusters can overlap, merge, or interact with other clusters.

---

## 10.7 Relationship to Cascading Collapse
Cluster emergence and cascading collapse are dual processes:

| Collapse | Emergence |
|---------|-----------|
| destructive | constructive |
| reduces structure | creates structure |
| propagates failure | propagates coherence |
| driven by \(\kappa_{net} \downarrow\) | driven by \(\kappa_{net} \uparrow\) |
| ends the network | transforms the network |

Both processes shape network evolution.

---

## 10.8 Cluster Stability
Cluster stability is defined as:
\[
\kappa_{\varepsilon}^{cluster} = 
\mathcal{E}_{\kappa}(C)
\]

Cluster stability determines:
- the lifetime of the emergent family,  
- the ability to form superclusters,  
- the potential for further emergence sequences.

---

## 10.9 Functional Role of Cluster Emergence
Cluster emergence:
- redistributes complexity in the network,  
- forms new layers of structural hierarchy,  
- introduces new subsystems with their own memory and time,  
- increases the depth and richness of network evolution,  
- is a primary mechanism of structural growth in Geonics 2.0.

---

Cluster emergence represents the positive, generative phase of network evolution, where coherent groups of interaction states transform into new families of emergent structures, expanding the hierarchical architecture of the geonic system.

---

# 11. Global Model of Geonic Networks

The global model provides the complete mathematical description of a geonic network as a coherent, evolving system. It unifies all components—global memory, global time, network fields, network geometry, group resonance, and network stability—into a single dynamic framework. This model generalizes the V1.2 single-interaction formalism to a fully distributed, multi-node system.

## 11.1 Global State Vector
The full network state is represented by the global state vector:
\[
X_{net} =
\left(
S_g,\;
F_g,\;
T_g,\;
M_g,\;
R_g,\;
\kappa_{net},\;
\{ X_e^{(i)} \}_{i=1}^{N},\;
E_{net}
\right)
\]

This vector includes both global components and all local interaction states.

---

## 11.2 Global Evolution Equation
The evolution of the entire network is governed by a global update rule:
\[
\frac{dX_{net}}{dt}
=
\mathcal{F}_{net}
\left(
S_g, F_g, T_g, M_g, R_g, \kappa_{net},
\{ X_e^{(i)} \}, E_{net}
\right)
\]

This defines how every part of the network changes over time.

---

## 11.3 Local-to-Global Component Mappings
Global components are computed from local components and connections:

### **Global Memory**
\[
M_g = \mathcal{G}_M(\{M_e^{(i)}\}, E_{net})
\]

### **Global Time**
\[
T_g = T_g(M_g)
\]

### **Network Fields**
\[
F_g = \mathcal{G}_F(\{F_e^{(i)}\}, S_g)
\]

### **Group Resonance**
\[
R_g = \mathcal{G}_R(F_g, S_g)
\]

### **Network Stability**
\[
\kappa_{net} = 
\mathcal{G}_{\kappa}(S_g, F_g, M_g, R_g)
\]

These mappings define the top-down and bottom-up interactions between local and global levels.

---

## 11.4 Global Dependency Hierarchy
The global model follows the strict non-cyclic structure:
\[
M_g \rightarrow T_g \rightarrow F_g \rightarrow S_g \rightarrow R_g \rightarrow \kappa_{net}.
\]

This hierarchy is the backbone of Geonics 2.0.

---

## 11.5 Node Evolution
Each local interaction state evolves according to:
\[
\frac{dX_e^{(i)}}{dt} = 
\mathcal{F}_{local}
\left(
S_e^{(i)}, F_e^{(i)}, T_e^{(i)}, M_e^{(i)}, R_e^{(i)}, \kappa_e^{(i)},
S_g, F_g, T_g
\right)
\]

Local states **depend on** global fields and geometry but do not directly depend on global stability.

---

## 11.6 Network Geometry Evolution
The global metric evolves as:
\[
g_g(t + 1) =
\mathcal{S}_g
\left(
g_g(t),\;
M_g(t),\;
F_g(t),\;
T_g(t)
\right)
\]

Curvature:
\[
R_g^{geo} = R(g_g)
\]

---

## 11.7 Field Evolution
\[
\frac{dF_g}{dt} =
\mathcal{G}_F'
\left(
S_g,\;
M_g,\;
\kappa_{net}
\right)
\]

Fields follow the geometry, memory pressure, and stability constraints.

---

## 11.8 Resonance Evolution
\[
\frac{dR_g}{dt} =
\mathcal{G}_R'
\left(
F_g,\;
S_g,\;
\kappa_{net}
\right)
\]

Resonance emerges from geometry and fields; stability regulates its amplitude.

---

## 11.9 Stability Evolution
\[
\frac{d\kappa_{net}}{dt} =
\mathcal{G}_{\kappa}'
\left(
S_g,\;
F_g,\;
M_g,\;
R_g
\right)
\]

Stability encapsulates all influences from geometry, memory, fields, and resonance.

---

## 11.10 Global Collapse Condition
The network collapses entirely when:
\[
\kappa_{net} = 0.
\]

Collapse dissolves:
- global geometry,  
- global fields,  
- global time,  
- all local interaction states,  
- all cluster structures.

No partial network collapse exists.

---

## 11.11 Global Emergence Condition
Cluster emergence occurs when:
\[
\kappa_{net} > \kappa_{cluster}^{min}
\]
and coherent clusters form within local regions of the network.

Cluster emergence may reorganize the global network into:
- super-clusters,  
- new global geometries,  
- redefined fields and stability regimes.

---

## 11.12 Functional Role of the Global Model
The global model describes:
- the full distributed evolution of a multi-interaction system,  
- interdependence between local and global variables,  
- pathways for collapse or emergence,  
- network-wide transformations,  
- the hierarchical dynamics of complex structural systems.

It is the complete mathematical engine behind Geonics 2.0.

---

The global model unifies all levels of interaction—local, cluster, and global—into a coherent, mathematically consistent framework for the evolution of geonic networks.

---

# 12. Axioms 2.0

The axioms of Geonics 2.0 define the fundamental laws governing multi-interaction networks. They generalize the axioms of V1.2 to systems composed of many interconnected interaction states and introduce global principles that regulate coherence, memory, time, fields, resonance, stability, and emergence across the entire network. These axioms form the unbreakable logical foundation of Geonics V2.0.

---

## **Axiom 1 — Existence of the Geonic Network**
A geonic network exists if and only if its global stability is positive:
\[
\kappa_{net} > 0.
\]
No configuration of nodes or links can form a coherent system without positive global stability.

---

## **Axiom 2 — Global Memory Monotonicity**
Global shared memory is strictly monotonic:
\[
\frac{dM_g}{dt} \ge 0.
\]
Irreversible accumulation of network-wide structural history drives all global dynamics.

---

## **Axiom 3 — Global Time Emerges from Global Memory**
Global time is generated solely from global memory:
\[
T_g = T_g(M_g).
\]
No other variable can generate or modify global temporal flow.

---

## **Axiom 4 — Fields Are Generated by Global Geometry and Memory**
Network fields are emergent and depend on:
\[
F_g = \mathcal{G}_F(S_g, M_g).
\]
They do not depend on resonance or stability directly.

---

## **Axiom 5 — Resonance Emerges from Fields and Geometry**
Group resonance depends only on:
\[
R_g = \mathcal{G}_R(F_g, S_g).
\]
It cannot depend on global time or memory directly, preserving the non-cyclic hierarchy.

---

## **Axiom 6 — Global Stability as a Unified Coherence Measure**
Global network stability is defined solely by:
\[
\kappa_{net} = \mathcal{G}_{\kappa}(S_g, F_g, M_g, R_g).
\]
No other independent variables contribute.

---

## **Axiom 7 — Non-Cyclic Dependency Principle**
All global variables obey the strict causal chain:
\[
M_g \rightarrow T_g \rightarrow F_g \rightarrow S_g \rightarrow R_g \rightarrow \kappa_{net}.
\]
No feedback loops or circular definitions are permitted.

---

## **Axiom 8 — Network Coherence**
A geonic network exists only if all linked interaction states maintain structural coherence:
\[
\text{coherence}(X_e^{(i)}, X_e^{(j)}) > 0.
\]
Loss of coherence diminishes \(\kappa_{net}\).

---

## **Axiom 9 — Propagation of Local Effects**
Any structural change in one node influences the entire network through:
- geometry \(S_g\),  
- fields \(F_g\),  
- memory \(M_g\),  
- resonance \(R_g\).

Local and global dynamics are inseparable.

---

## **Axiom 10 — Irreversibility of Network Evolution**
A geonic network cannot:
- reduce its global memory,  
- reverse its global time,  
- revert to a simpler connectivity state.

Network evolution is fundamentally irreversible.

---

## **Axiom 11 — Cascading Collapse as a Natural Outcome**
If global stability reaches zero:
\[
\kappa_{net} = 0,
\]
the entire network collapses instantaneously, regardless of the local states.  
Collapse propagation is an inherent property, not an anomaly.

---

## **Axiom 12 — Cluster Emergence as a Constructive Outcome**
When global stability is sufficiently positive:
\[
\kappa_{net} > \kappa_{cluster}^{min},
\]
coherent subsets of the network undergo cluster emergence, forming families of new structures.

---

## **Axiom 13 — Independence of Emergent Clusters**
Emergent cluster-structures do not depend on the original network that produced them:
\[
X_{\varepsilon}^{cluster} \not\equiv X_e^{(i)},
\qquad
X_{\varepsilon}^{cluster} \not\equiv X_{e}^{net}.
\]
Cluster emergence produces independent higher-order structures.

---

## **Axiom 14 — Network-Level Irreducibility**
The behavior of the geonic network cannot be reduced to the behavior of individual nodes:
\[
X_{e}^{net} \neq \sum_i X_e^{(i)}.
\]
The network is a structurally independent system.

---

## **Axiom 15 — Structural Closure**
All global processes—memory, time, fields, geometry, resonance, and stability—are fully determined inside the network. No external variable or influence can enter the system’s fundamental dynamics.

---

These axioms complete the formal foundation of Geonics 2.0 and ensure full logical consistency across all levels of the theory.

---

# 13. Computational Model 2.0

The Computational Model 2.0 defines how geonic networks can be simulated, evaluated, and evolved in numerical or algorithmic environments. Unlike the local computational model of V1.2, the network model requires distributed processing, global–local synchronization, graph-based topology handling, and multi-layer propagation of fields, geometry, and stability. This section describes the complete computational backbone of Geonics V2.0.

---

## 13.1 Representation of the Network State

The full network state is stored as a structured data object:
\[
X_{net} =
\left(
S_g,\; F_g,\; T_g,\; M_g,\; R_g,\; \kappa_{net},\;
\{ X_e^{(i)} \},\; E_{net}
\right)
\]

Each local state:
\[
X_e^{(i)} =
\left(
S_e^{(i)},\; F_e^{(i)},\; T_e^{(i)},\; M_e^{(i)},\; R_e^{(i)},\; \kappa_e^{(i)}
\right)
\]

The network is represented as:
- a **graph** (nodes = Xe, edges = structural links),  
- a **field map**,  
- a **geometry tensor**,  
- a **distributed memory accumulator**,  
- a **network stability scalar**.

---

## 13.2 Global Update Cycle

Each simulation step \(dt\) performs a **strictly ordered update cycle**, respecting the non-cyclic dependency hierarchy.

### **Step 1 — Update global memory**
\[
M_g \leftarrow M_g + \mathcal{G}_M'(\{M_e^{(i)}\}, E_{net})\cdot dt
\]

### **Step 2 — Update global time**
\[
T_g \leftarrow T_g + \mathcal{T}_g(M_g, \kappa_{net})\cdot dt
\]

### **Step 3 — Update network fields**
\[
F_g \leftarrow F_g + \mathcal{G}_F'(S_g, M_g, \kappa_{net})\cdot dt
\]

### **Step 4 — Update network geometry**
\[
g_g \leftarrow \mathcal{S}_g(g_g, M_g, F_g, T_g)
\]

Recompute curvature:
\[
R_g^{geo} = R(g_g)
\]

### **Step 5 — Update group resonance**
\[
R_g \leftarrow R_g + \mathcal{G}_R'(F_g, S_g, \kappa_{net})\cdot dt
\]

### **Step 6 — Update network stability**
\[
\kappa_{net} \leftarrow 
\kappa_{net} + 
\mathcal{G}_{\kappa}'(S_g, F_g, M_g, R_g)\cdot dt
\]

This completes the global phase.

---

## 13.3 Local Update Cycle

Each node updates after the global components:

\[
\frac{dX_e^{(i)}}{dt} =
\mathcal{F}_{local}
\left(
X_e^{(i)},\;
S_g,\; F_g,\; T_g
\right)
\]

Local updates depend on the global state, ensuring coherence across the network.

Local time:
\[
T_e^{(i)} \leftarrow T_e^{(i)} + \mathcal{T}(M_e^{(i)}, \kappa_e^{(i)})\cdot dt
\]

Local stability:
\[
\kappa_e^{(i)} \leftarrow \kappa_e^{(i)} + \mathcal{K}'(S_e^{(i)}, F_e^{(i)}, M_e^{(i)}, R_e^{(i)})\cdot dt
\]

---

## 13.4 Detection of Collapse Cascades

After each update cycle:

### **Local collapse check**
If \(\kappa_e^{(i)} = 0\):
- disable node \(i\);  
- remove edges from \(E_{net}\);  
- propagate collapse impulse through fields and geometry.

### **Global collapse check**
If:
\[
\kappa_{net} = 0
\]
→ stop simulation, network has fully collapsed.

---

## 13.5 Detection of Cluster Emergence

After stability increases and coherence patterns appear:

### A cluster \(C\) is detected if:
- internal coherence high,  
- local stabilities support transformation,  
- resonance synchronized,  
- geometry locally consistent.

Then:
\[
X_{\varepsilon}^{cluster} = \mathcal{E}_{cluster}(C)
\]

The cluster becomes a new structural family.

---

## 13.6 Distributed Simulation Architecture

A correct implementation must support:

- **parallel node updates** (GPU or multi-threaded),  
- **synchronous global updates**,  
- **graph-based propagation** of geometry and fields,  
- **distributed memory accumulation**,  
- **dynamic topology updates** as nodes collapse or emerge.

This ensures scalability to large networks.

---

## 13.7 Computational Integrity Requirements

To ensure theoretical fidelity:

- update order must never be violated,  
- global memory cannot decrease,  
- global time cannot reverse,  
- field and geometry updates must respect network topology,  
- resonance cannot depend on time derivatives,  
- collapse and emergence must be treated as terminal events for affected components.

These constraints preserve the non-cyclic and irreversible nature of Geonics.

---

## 13.8 Simulation Outputs

A Geonics 2.0 simulation outputs:

- the evolution of global variables over time,  
- the stability landscape,  
- collapse cascades,  
- emergence clusters,  
- phase transitions,  
- geometric deformation maps,  
- node-level dynamics,  
- propagation metrics of fields and resonance.

---

The Computational Model 2.0 provides the complete algorithmic foundation for implementing and simulating geonic networks, enabling analysis of distributed interaction dynamics across complex structural systems.

# Appendix E — Computational Model Examples

This appendix provides concrete, self-contained examples of computational patterns used to simulate, analyze, and validate geonic networks. These examples demonstrate how the theoretical model of Geonics V2.0 translates into algorithmic form, using simplified but structurally correct pseudo-code and matrix formulations. Every example respects the strict non-cyclic dependency hierarchy.

# E.1 Example: Initialization of a Geonic Network

Given:
- N local interaction states
- adjacency matrix A
- initial local memories M_e(i)(0)

Initialization:
for i in 1..N:
    X_e[i] = initialize_local_state(i)
end

E_net = adjacency_matrix_to_edge_list(A)

M_g = G_M({ M_e[i] }, E_net)
T_g = T_g(M_g)

F_g = G_F({ F_e[i] }, S_g)
R_g = G_R(F_g, S_g)

k_net = G_kappa(S_g, F_g, M_g, R_g)

This creates the initial network state X_net(0).

# E.2 Example: One Full Global Simulation Step

Every simulation step updates global variables in strict order:

1) Global Memory:
M_g += G_M_prime({ M_e[i] }, E_net) * dt

2) Global Time:
T_g += T_g_rate(M_g, k_net) * dt

3) Network Fields:
F_g += G_F_prime(S_g, M_g, k_net) * dt

4) Network Geometry:
g_g = S_g_evolve(g_g, M_g, F_g, T_g)
R_geo = curvature(g_g)

5) Group Resonance:
R_g += G_R_prime(F_g, S_g, k_net) * dt

6) Global Stability:
k_net += G_kappa_prime(S_g, F_g, M_g, R_g) * dt

This sequence must not be altered.

# E.3 Example: Local Node Update

After global update, each node evolves:

X_e[i].M += M_local_rate(X_e[i]) * dt
X_e[i].T += T_local_rate(X_e[i]) * dt
X_e[i].F += F_local_rate(X_e[i], S_g, F_g) * dt
X_e[i].S = S_local_evolve(X_e[i].S, X_e[i].M, X_e[i].F, X_e[i].T)
X_e[i].R += R_local_rate(X_e[i]) * dt
X_e[i].k += k_local_rate(X_e[i]) * dt

Local updates depend on global variables but never alter them.

# E.4 Example: Detecting Collapse Cascades

Local collapse:
k_e(i) = 0

Propagation:
mark_node_as_collapsed(i)
for each j connected to i:
    propagate_collapse_impulse(i, j)

Collapse impulse affects:
- network geometry S_g
- network fields F_g
- global resonance R_g
- global stability k_net

Global collapse:
k_net = 0 → network termination.

# E.5 Example: Cluster Detection

Cluster C is detected if:
coherence(i,j) > threshold

Algorithm:
C = empty set
for each (i,j) in E_net:
    if coherence(X_e[i], X_e[j]) > threshold:
        add (i,j) to C

If C meets coherence + stability criteria → cluster is valid.

# E.6 Example: Cluster Emergence

For cluster C:
X_eps[i].M = T_M(X_e[i].M)
X_eps[i].T = T_T(X_e[i].T)
X_eps[i].Phi = T_Phi(X_e[i].F)
X_eps[i].Delta = T_Delta(X_e[i].S)
X_eps[i].k = T_kappa(X_e[i].k)

Cluster geometry:
S_eps_cluster = E_S(C)
Cluster stability:
k_eps_cluster = E_kappa(C)

Cluster becomes a new structural family.

# E.7 Example: Use of Adjacency and Laplacian Matrices

Adjacency matrix:
A_ij = 1 if (i,j) in E_net else 0

Graph Laplacian:
L = D - A

Used for:
- geometric smoothing
- resonance propagation
- field diffusion

Example:
F_g(t+dt) = F_g(t) + λ * L * F_g(t)

# E.8 Example: Network Collapse vs. Emergence Logic

Collapse:
if k_net <= 0:
    terminate_simulation("Network collapsed")

Emergence:
if k_net > cluster_threshold AND coherence pattern detected:
    trigger_cluster_emergence(C)

Network ends in one of two terminal states:
- full collapse
- cluster emergence

# E.9 Example: Minimal Working Simulation Loop

initialize_network()

while time < Tmax:
    update_global_state(dt)
    update_local_states(dt)
    detect_collapse()
    detect_clusters()

    if network_collapsed():
        break

    if cluster_emergence_detected():
        form_cluster()
        break

    time += dt
end

This loop reproduces the fundamental network dynamics predicted by Geonics V2.0.
