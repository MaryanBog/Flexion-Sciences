# Theory of Geonic Fields  
(Geonics-Sciences)

## 1. Scope and Position

This document defines the **Theory of Geonic Fields**,  
a foundational theoretical line within **Geonics-Sciences**.

The theory studies **fields not as forces or carriers**,  
but as **active states of the interaction space** that arise
after sustained, non-empty interactions.

This theory presupposes:
- the Theory of Interaction Structures,
- the existence of memory,
- the possibility of κ > 0.

It introduces no new agents, goals, or control mechanisms.

## 2. From Interaction to Field

Interaction Structures describe **events**.

Geonic Fields describe what remains **between events**.

A Geonic Field arises when:
- non-empty interactions have occurred,
- memory has been retained,
- and κ > 0 has allowed continuity.

A single interaction is insufficient.
Fields are **collective consequences** of retained interactions.

---

## 3. Definition of Geonic Field

A **Geonic Field** is defined as:

> **An active, distributed state of the interaction space  
> that alters the conditions and probabilities  
> of future interactions,  
> independently of repeating past events.**

A field is not a record of history.
It is a modification of **present possibility**.

---

## 4. Field vs Memory

Memory is a trace of an event.  
A field is a condition of the present.

Key distinctions:

- Memory is passive; fields are active.
- Memory belongs to what happened; fields belong to what can happen.
- Memory may exist without a field.
- A field cannot exist without prior memory, but is not reducible to it.

---

## 5. Field as Active Background

A Geonic Field exists **between interactions**.

Even when no interaction occurs:
- the field modifies likelihood,
- the field shapes compatibility,
- the field biases future structure formation.

If a state does not act between events, it is not a field.

---

## 6. Independence from Subjects

Geonic Fields:
- do not belong to any single entity,
- do not require awareness,
- do not require interpretation,
- do not require intention.

They exist as **structural facts**, not subjective states.

---

## 7. Temporality of Geonic Fields

Geonic Fields are **not permanent**.

> **In the absence of sustaining interactions,  
> a Geonic Field must decay and disappear.**

Fields are not substances.
They require ongoing structural support.

---

## 8. Field Disappearance

When a Geonic Field disappears:
- no component of the field remains,
- no partial field persists,
- no residual structure is guaranteed.

Field disappearance is **total**, not fragmentary.

This does not negate:
- past interactions,
- past memory,
- historical irreversibility.

It only negates the **active field state**.

---

## 9. Relation to κ

κ does not guarantee permanence.

κ indicates:
- compatibility with continuation,
- absence of internal self-destruction.

If sustaining interactions cease:
- κ loses support,
- the field decays,
- the space returns toward neutrality.

---

## 10. Minimal Structural Chain

The theory establishes the following chain:

1. Interaction Structures (events)
2. Memory (trace)
3. κ > 0 (retention)
4. Geonic Field (active state)
5. Field decay in absence of interaction

No step implies the next.
Each requires independent conditions.

---

## 11. Boundary of the Theory

This theory does not address:
- field geometry,
- field metrics,
- field gradients,
- interaction networks,
- emergence of new entities.

These belong to other theoretical lines within Geonics-Sciences.

## 12. Status

The Theory of Geonic Fields is **structurally complete**  
at the level defined in this document.

It defines:
- what a field is,
- how it arises,
- how it exists,
- how it disappears,
- and where the theory must stop.

Further development must occur at a higher or adjacent theoretical level.
