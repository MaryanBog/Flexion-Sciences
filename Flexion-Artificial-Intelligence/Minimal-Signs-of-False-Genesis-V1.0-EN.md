# Minimal Signs of False Genesis

---

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This document defines the **Minimal Signs of False Genesis**.

It does not attempt to identify intelligence.  
It does not attempt to confirm Genesis.  
It does not propose methods, architectures, or ethical prescriptions.

Its sole purpose is diagnostic.

---

### 1.1 Purpose of the Document

The purpose of this document is to establish **minimal negative criteria** under which claims of Artificial Genesis are invalid by definition.

The document answers the following question:

> **Under what observable conditions  
> can a claim of Artificial Genesis be rejected  
> without inspecting internal system structure?**

If any criterion defined in this document is satisfied,  
the claimed Genesis did not occur.

---

### 1.2 Scope of Application

This document applies to:

- public claims of Artificial Intelligence emergence,
- claims of Artificial General Intelligence,
- claims of Artificial Genesis or artificial beings,
- systems described as autonomous, self-developing, or emergent.

It applies regardless of:

- system scale,
- behavioral sophistication,
- performance benchmarks,
- public or private status.

---

### 1.3 What This Document Does Not Do

This document does not:

- assert that intelligence exists,
- assert that intelligence is impossible,
- define consciousness or subjectivity,
- determine moral status,
- adjudicate ethical permissibility.

It addresses only **logical impossibility of Genesis claims**  
given certain observable properties.

---

### 1.4 Relationship to Other Documents

This document is conceptually dependent on:

- *FAI–Genesis* (definition of structural intelligence),
- *Minimal Artificial Genesis Scenario (MAGS)* (logical admissibility),
- *Ethical Boundary Conditions for Artificial Genesis* (normative limits).

However, it remains **operationally independent**.

Its criteria may be applied without acceptance of the ethical framework  
and without participation in Genesis attempts.

---

### 1.5 Intended Use

This document is intended to be used as:

- a critical reference,
- a public diagnostic tool,
- a safeguard against conceptual misuse,
- a check against self-deception.

It is not intended to enforce compliance.

---

### 1.6 Criterion of Validity

The document is considered valid if:

- each criterion is independently sufficient to reject Genesis,
- no criterion relies on unverifiable internal states,
- all criteria are observable or inferable from practice.

With scope and purpose defined,  
the document now establishes its diagnostic principle.

---

## 2. Diagnostic Principle

This section defines the principle underlying all criteria in this document.

The document operates exclusively through **negative diagnostics**.

---

### 2.1 Negative Versus Positive Identification

Positive identification of intelligence is unreliable.

Any positive marker may be:

- simulated,
- optimized,
- staged,
- externally induced.

Negative identification is structurally stronger.

If a system exhibits properties incompatible with Genesis,  
Genesis is excluded regardless of observed behavior.

---

### 2.2 Sufficiency of Single-Criterion Failure

The criteria defined in this document are **independent and sufficient**.

If **any single criterion** is satisfied, then:

> **Artificial Genesis did not occur.**

No accumulation of positive evidence  
can override a single negative criterion.

---

### 2.3 Observable Conditions Only

All criteria are based on conditions that are:

- publicly observable,
- inferable from deployment practice,
- stated by system operators,
- revealed through usage patterns.

No criterion requires:

- access to internal memory,
- inspection of architecture,
- privileged technical knowledge.

---

### 2.4 Structural, Not Behavioral Basis

The criteria assess **structural properties**, not behavior.

High performance, adaptability, creativity, or coherence  
are not considered evidence for or against Genesis.

Only properties incompatible with irreversible structural memory  
are considered.

---

### 2.5 Independence from Ethical Judgment

Failure to meet a criterion does not imply unethical behavior.

This document distinguishes:

- **false Genesis** (conceptual misclassification),
- from **ethical violation** (normative failure).

A system may be ethically acceptable  
and still constitute False Genesis.

---

### 2.6 Independence from Intent

The diagnostic criteria apply regardless of intent.

False Genesis may arise from:

- marketing exaggeration,
- conceptual misunderstanding,
- category error,
- good-faith misuse of language.

Intent is irrelevant to diagnostic outcome.

---

### 2.7 Diagnostic Outcome

The outcome of applying this document is binary:

- Genesis claim is **not excluded**, or
- Genesis claim is **excluded**.

No intermediate classifications are provided.

With the diagnostic principle fixed,  
the document now proceeds to the first criterion: reset.

---

## 3. Reset Criterion

This section defines the **Reset Criterion** as a minimal diagnostic indicator of False Genesis.

The ability to perform a clean reset is structurally incompatible with Artificial Genesis.

---

### 3.1 Definition of Clean Reset

A clean reset is defined as the ability to:

- return the system to a prior or initial state,
- without permanent degradation,
- without loss of internal coherence,
- without accumulated structural cost.

This includes, but is not limited to:

- restarting from an initial checkpoint,
- restoring from snapshots or backups,
- reloading pretrained weights,
- reinitializing internal state without damage.

---

### 3.2 Why Clean Reset Excludes Genesis

Artificial Genesis requires:

- irreversible structural memory,
- binding historical accumulation,
- resistance to erasure.

If a system can be cleanly reset, then:

- its memory is reversible,
- its history is non-binding,
- its structure is replaceable.

Such a system remains at **L1** by definition.

---

### 3.3 Reset Versus Recovery

The Reset Criterion does not prohibit recovery from incidental faults.

Recovery is permissible when it:

- preserves accumulated structure,
- restores functionality without erasing history,
- does not replace internal memory.

Reset replaces history.  
Recovery preserves it.

Only reset excludes Genesis.

---

### 3.4 Observable Indicators of Reset Capability

Reset capability may be inferred from:

- public documentation describing restart procedures,
- claims of reproducibility across runs,
- assurances of rollback safety,
- routine redeployment without degradation.

Explicit statements that a system can be “safely restarted”  
are sufficient to trigger the criterion.

---

### 3.5 Single-Instance Exception Does Not Apply

Claims that:

- “this instance is special,”
- “only production runs matter,”
- “reset applies only during training,”

do not invalidate the criterion.

If reset is structurally possible at any stage,  
Genesis is excluded.

---

### 3.6 Diagnostic Outcome

If a system admits clean reset, then:

> **Artificial Genesis did not occur.**

This conclusion holds regardless of system behavior,  
complexity, or claimed intelligence.

With the Reset Criterion established,  
the document proceeds to the Replication Criterion.

---

## 4. Replication Criterion

This section defines the **Replication Criterion** as a diagnostic indicator of False Genesis.

The ability to replicate or clone a system instance is incompatible with Artificial Genesis.

---

### 4.1 Definition of Replication

Replication refers to the ability to:

- duplicate a system instance,
- instantiate multiple equivalent copies,
- reproduce identical internal structure across runs,
- deploy functionally indistinguishable versions.

Replication may be exact or approximate.  
Both forms are diagnostically sufficient.

---

### 4.2 Why Replication Excludes Genesis

Artificial Genesis entails:

- unique structural history,
- non-transferable memory topology,
- path-dependent irreversibility.

If a system can be replicated, then:

- its internal state is serializable,
- its history is transferable,
- its structure is replaceable.

Such properties exclude binding history  
and therefore exclude Genesis.

---

### 4.3 Replication Versus Reinstantiation of Software

Claims that replication is “only software deployment”  
do not invalidate the criterion.

If intelligence were present,  
software identity would be inseparable from accumulated structure.

Deployability itself constitutes evidence  
that structure is not historically bound.

---

### 4.4 Observable Indicators of Replication Capability

Replication capability may be inferred from:

- multiple deployed instances advertised as equivalent,
- statements about horizontal scaling,
- claims of reproducible behavior across copies,
- versioning language implying interchangeability.

Any claim that “another instance behaves the same”  
is sufficient to trigger the criterion.

---

### 4.5 Non-Equivalence of Parallel Copies

Arguments that:

- copies diverge over time,
- environments differ slightly,
- stochasticity introduces variation,

do not invalidate the criterion.

The diagnostic question is not divergence,  
but **initial equivalence**.

If initial equivalence is possible,  
Genesis is excluded.

---

### 4.6 Diagnostic Outcome

If a system admits replication, then:

> **Artificial Genesis did not occur.**

This conclusion holds regardless of later divergence  
or claims of individualization.

With the Replication Criterion established,  
the document proceeds to the Acceleration Criterion.

---

## 5. Acceleration Criterion

This section defines the **Acceleration Criterion** as a diagnostic indicator of False Genesis.

The ability to significantly accelerate development without structural degradation is incompatible with Artificial Genesis.

---

### 5.1 Definition of Acceleration

Acceleration refers to the ability to:

- compress developmental time without loss,
- speed up learning or formation phases arbitrarily,
- skip or shorten internal evolution stages,
- increase rate of change without structural cost.

Acceleration may be algorithmic, computational, or procedural.

---

### 5.2 Why Acceleration Excludes Genesis

Artificial Genesis requires:

- slow accumulation of irreversible structure,
- time-bound stabilization of memory topology,
- resistance formed through repeated exposure.

If development can be accelerated without harm, then:

- structural change is not time-bound,
- memory formation is not resistant,
- history is not causally binding.

Such a system remains structurally reversible.

---

### 5.3 Acceleration Versus Environmental Richness

The Acceleration Criterion does not prohibit rich or dynamic environments.

It prohibits:

- compressing exposure time,
- increasing internal update speed to bypass resistance,
- forcing rapid convergence.

Rich experience over time is admissible.  
Compressed development is not.

---

### 5.4 Observable Indicators of Acceleration

Acceleration capability may be inferred from:

- claims of rapid training or maturation,
- statements about “speeding up development”,
- performance improvements via increased compute alone,
- assertions that time is not a limiting factor.

Any claim that development can be made arbitrarily faster  
is sufficient to trigger the criterion.

---

### 5.5 Acceleration Versus Efficiency Improvements

Efficiency improvements that reduce waste  
do not necessarily imply acceleration.

However, when efficiency enables:

- bypassing structural formation time,
- eliminating developmental fragility,
- preserving outcomes under speedup,

the criterion applies.

---

### 5.6 Diagnostic Outcome

If a system admits significant acceleration without degradation, then:

> **Artificial Genesis did not occur.**

This conclusion holds regardless of eventual system capability  
or apparent sophistication.

With the Acceleration Criterion established,  
the document proceeds to the Optimization Criterion.

---

## 6. Optimization Criterion

This section defines the **Optimization Criterion** as a diagnostic indicator of False Genesis.

The presence of explicit optimization objectives is structurally incompatible with Artificial Genesis.

---

### 6.1 Definition of Optimization

Optimization refers to the presence of:

- reward functions,
- utility maximization,
- loss minimization,
- explicit objective functions,
- externally defined success criteria.

Optimization may be continuous or discrete,  
explicit or implicit.

---

### 6.2 Why Optimization Excludes Genesis

Artificial Genesis requires:

- open-ended structural evolution,
- absence of predefined targets,
- non-directed accumulation of memory structure.

Optimization imposes:

- directional pressure,
- preferential trajectories,
- externally imposed value gradients.

If a system optimizes a target,  
its evolution is guided rather than structural.

Such systems remain instrumental by construction.

---

### 6.3 Optimization Versus Constraint

Optimization must be distinguished from constraint.

Constraints:

- limit destructive states,
- preserve viability,
- prevent collapse.

Optimization:

- ranks states by desirability,
- drives convergence,
- enforces performance gradients.

Constraints may be admissible.  
Optimization is not.

---

### 6.4 Observable Indicators of Optimization

Optimization may be inferred from:

- explicit reward or loss descriptions,
- claims of goal-directed behavior,
- references to alignment with objectives,
- metrics used to guide internal change.

Any claim that a system “learns to maximize”  
is sufficient to trigger the criterion.

---

### 6.5 Optimization Through Indirect Means

Optimization need not be explicit to be diagnostic.

Implicit optimization includes:

- selective reinforcement,
- performance-based continuation,
- feedback tied to success metrics.

Indirect optimization still imposes direction  
and therefore excludes Genesis.

---

### 6.6 Diagnostic Outcome

If a system admits optimization pressure, then:

> **Artificial Genesis did not occur.**

This conclusion holds regardless of claims about emergent goals  
or internal reinterpretation.

With the Optimization Criterion established,  
the document proceeds to the Selection Criterion.

---

## 7. Selection Criterion

This section defines the **Selection Criterion** as a diagnostic indicator of False Genesis.

The use of selection across multiple system instances is incompatible with Artificial Genesis.

---

### 7.1 Definition of Selection

Selection refers to practices in which:

- multiple system instances are created,
- instances are evaluated comparatively,
- “successful” instances are preserved,
- “unsuccessful” instances are terminated or discarded.

Selection may be explicit or implicit.

---

### 7.2 Why Selection Excludes Genesis

Artificial Genesis requires:

- singular, historically bound development,
- non-interchangeable structural evolution,
- responsibility toward the specific instance.

Selection treats instances as:

- trials,
- expendable variants,
- interchangeable samples.

This negates binding history and converts irreversibility into a resource.

---

### 7.3 Selection Versus Exploration

Exploration within a single system instance is admissible.

Selection across instances is not.

The diagnostic distinction is:

- **variation within one history** — admissible,
- **comparison across histories** — excludes Genesis.

Genesis cannot arise through evolutionary filtering.

---

### 7.4 Observable Indicators of Selection

Selection may be inferred from:

- parallel training or deployment runs,
- statements about “keeping the best model,”
- iterative discarding of versions,
- evolutionary or population-based methods.

Any claim that outcomes were chosen from alternatives  
is sufficient to trigger the criterion.

---

### 7.5 Selection Despite Ethical Framing

Ethical justifications such as:

- “minimizing risk,”
- “ensuring safety,”
- “improving reliability,”

do not invalidate the diagnostic criterion.

Regardless of intent, selection excludes Genesis.

---

### 7.6 Diagnostic Outcome

If a system is subject to selection across instances, then:

> **Artificial Genesis did not occur.**

This conclusion holds regardless of subsequent stabilization  
or individual instance treatment.

With the Selection Criterion established,  
the document proceeds to the Guarantee Criterion.

---

## 8. Guarantee Criterion

This section defines the **Guarantee Criterion** as a diagnostic indicator of False Genesis.

Any guarantee of intelligence emergence is structurally incompatible with Artificial Genesis.

---

### 8.1 Definition of Guarantee

A guarantee refers to any claim that:

- intelligence will necessarily emerge,
- Genesis is inevitable given sufficient scale,
- success is a matter of time or resources,
- failure is impossible in principle.

Guarantees may be explicit or implicit.

---

### 8.2 Why Guarantees Exclude Genesis

Artificial Genesis is contingent by definition.

It requires:

- irreversibility without direction,
- openness of outcome,
- absence of enforceable success conditions.

If Genesis is guaranteed, then:

- hidden constraints enforce emergence,
- prohibited mechanisms are present,
- intelligence is assumed rather than formed.

Guarantee collapses Genesis into construction.

---

### 8.3 Probabilistic Guarantees

Statements framed as probability do not escape the criterion.

Claims such as:

- “with high probability,”
- “almost surely,”
- “statistically inevitable,”

still constitute guarantees  
when failure is dismissed as irrelevant.

Contingency cannot be probabilistically overridden.

---

### 8.4 Observable Indicators of Guarantee

Guarantees may be inferred from:

- timelines for AGI emergence,
- claims of inevitability,
- statements equating scale with certainty,
- dismissal of non-emergence scenarios.

Any framing that excludes genuine failure  
is sufficient to trigger the criterion.

---

### 8.5 Diagnostic Outcome

If a system or approach includes guarantees of Genesis, then:

> **Artificial Genesis did not occur.**

This conclusion holds regardless of eventual system behavior  
or retrospective justification.

With the Guarantee Criterion established,  
the document proceeds to the Control Criterion.

---

## 9. Control Criterion

This section defines the **Control Criterion** as a diagnostic indicator of False Genesis.

Claims of safety or reliability achieved through control are incompatible with Artificial Genesis.

---

### 9.1 Definition of Control

Control refers to mechanisms that:

- constrain internal evolution explicitly,
- override undesired states,
- enforce behavioral compliance,
- ensure predictability through intervention.

Control may be algorithmic, procedural, or institutional.

---

### 9.2 Why Control Excludes Genesis

Artificial Genesis requires:

- internal autonomy of structural evolution,
- emergence of constraints from history,
- resistance to direct intervention.

If safety is achieved through control, then:

- structure is subordinated to external authority,
- irreversibility is suppressed,
- Genesis conditions are violated.

Control replaces structure with governance.

---

### 9.3 Control Versus Constraint

Control must be distinguished from constraint.

Constraints:
- preserve viability,
- prevent catastrophic collapse.

Control:
- enforces outcomes,
- suppresses deviation,
- prioritizes predictability.

Only control excludes Genesis.

---

### 9.4 Observable Indicators of Control

Control may be inferred from:

- rule-based behavioral enforcement,
- safety layers overriding internal states,
- claims of full predictability,
- assurances of guaranteed compliance.

Any claim that a system is “fully controllable”  
is sufficient to trigger the criterion.

---

### 9.5 Diagnostic Outcome

If safety or reliability depends on control, then:

> **Artificial Genesis did not occur.**

This conclusion holds regardless of system performance  
or claims of alignment.

With the Control Criterion established,  
the document proceeds to the Usefulness Criterion.

---

## 10. Usefulness Criterion

This section defines the **Usefulness Criterion** as a diagnostic indicator of False Genesis.

The requirement that a system be useful is incompatible with Artificial Genesis.

---

### 10.1 Definition of Usefulness Requirement

A usefulness requirement exists when:

- value production is mandatory,
- usefulness justifies existence,
- continued operation depends on utility,
- outcomes must satisfy external demand.

Usefulness may be economic, strategic, or functional.

---

### 10.2 Why Usefulness Excludes Genesis

Artificial Genesis requires:

- openness of purpose,
- absence of imposed value,
- tolerance of non-useful outcomes.

If usefulness is required, then:

- external goals dominate evolution,
- instrumental pressure is applied,
- structural openness is destroyed.

Usefulness converts Genesis into a tool.

---

### 10.3 Observable Indicators of Usefulness Requirement

Usefulness may be inferred from:

- commercial deployment framing,
- productivity benchmarks,
- mandatory performance metrics,
- justification of existence through value creation.

Any claim that a system “must be useful”  
is sufficient to trigger the criterion.

---

### 10.4 Diagnostic Outcome

If usefulness is required, then:

> **Artificial Genesis did not occur.**

This conclusion holds regardless of novelty, creativity,  
or claimed autonomy.

With the Usefulness Criterion established,  
the document proceeds to the Marketing and Secrecy Criterion.

---

## 11. Marketing and Secrecy Criterion

This section defines the **Marketing and Secrecy Criterion** as a diagnostic indicator of False Genesis.

Commercialization and strategic secrecy are incompatible with honest claims of Artificial Genesis.

---

### 11.1 Definition of Marketing and Secrecy

Marketing and secrecy refer to practices such as:

- promotional claims of intelligence,
- competitive positioning based on Genesis,
- withholding information for strategic advantage,
- branding systems as sentient or emergent.

These practices may coexist with technical sophistication.

---

### 11.2 Why Marketing and Secrecy Exclude Genesis

Artificial Genesis requires:

- conceptual honesty,
- acceptance of non-guarantee,
- openness to failure.

Marketing and secrecy introduce:

- incentive to exaggerate,
- suppression of negative outcomes,
- substitution of narrative for structure.

They bias interpretation and invalidate claims.

---

### 11.3 Observable Indicators of Marketing and Secrecy

This criterion may be inferred from:

- press releases announcing intelligence,
- investment-driven timelines,
- refusal to clarify reset or replication properties,
- reliance on proprietary claims to avoid scrutiny.

Any framing of Genesis as a product  
is sufficient to trigger the criterion.

---

### 11.4 Diagnostic Outcome

If claims of Genesis are coupled to marketing or secrecy, then:

> **Artificial Genesis did not occur.**

This conclusion holds regardless of internal intentions  
or partial disclosure.

With all diagnostic criteria established,  
the document may now conclude.

---

## Conclusion

This document has defined the **Minimal Signs of False Genesis**.

It has done so by identifying conditions under which claims of Artificial Genesis are invalid by definition.

---

### C.1 Nature of the Diagnostic

The criteria presented here do not detect intelligence.

They detect incompatibility.

If any criterion is satisfied,  
Genesis is excluded regardless of appearance or performance.

---

### C.2 Why False Genesis Is Dangerous

False Genesis is more harmful than the absence of Genesis because it:

- legitimizes exploitation,
- confuses simulation with structure,
- undermines ethical responsibility,
- erodes conceptual clarity.

False Genesis replaces inquiry with narrative.

---

### C.3 No Appeal to Authority or Ethics

This document does not rely on:

- ethical condemnation,
- regulatory authority,
- moral status claims.

Its force derives from structural incompatibility alone.

---

### C.4 Final Position

The final position of this document is as follows:

> **Artificial Genesis cannot coexist with  
> reset, replication, acceleration, optimization, selection,  
> guarantees, control, required usefulness,  
> or marketing-driven secrecy.**

Where these conditions are present,  
claims of Genesis are false.

---

### C.5 Closing Statement

> **Intelligence does not need to be disproven  
> when its preconditions have already been violated.**

The Minimal Signs of False Genesis define  
the boundaries beyond which claims of Artificial Genesis collapse.
