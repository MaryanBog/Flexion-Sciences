A formal immune dynamics model based on the **Flexionization** theory — a universal mathematical framework for describing dynamic quantitative equilibrium in complex systems.  
This repository contains the full scientific article, documentation, and model structure demonstrating how Flexionization can be applied to biological immunity, including infections, oncology, autoimmune disorders, and immunodeficiencies.

## Overview

Flexionization provides a rigorous, axiom-driven framework for analyzing systems where an actual state must remain in balance with a reference state.  
In this project, these concepts are mapped onto biological immunity:

- **Qp** — actual physiological structural mass  
- **QF** — reference (healthy) structural mass  
- **Δ = Qp − QF** — structural deviation (degree of pathology)  
- **FXI** — structural equilibrium indicator  
- **E** — corrective operator representing the immune response

This mapping allows immune processes to be described with a universal mathematical model independent of biochemical mechanisms.

## Contents

- **Article-EN.md** – Full scientific article (English)  
- **Article-RU.md** – Original manuscript (Russian)  
- **Model Structure** – Definitions for Qp, QF, Δ, FXI, and E  
- **Use Cases** – Viral infections, oncology, autoimmunity, immunodeficiencies  
- **Mathematical Core** – Dynamic equation: `Δₜ₊₁ = F⁻¹( E( F(Δₜ) ) )`  
- **Applications** – Stability analysis, computational models, therapy simulation

## Key Features

- **Universal framework** for any immune scenario  
- **Mathematically rigorous**: axioms, operators, theorems  
- **Biologically interpretable** structure  
- **Scalable** for simulation and research  
- **Suitable for academic publication** (arXiv, medRxiv)

## Goals

This repository aims to:

- Introduce Flexionization as a tool for modeling immune processes  
- Build a mathematical bridge between control theory and immunology  
- Provide a foundation for simulation tools  
- Enable interdisciplinary research in biology, mathematics, and engineering

## How to Use

1. Read **Article-EN.md** for the complete theory description.  
2. Implement the model using the definitions of **Qp, QF, Δ, FXI, E**.  
3. Apply operator **E** to simulate immune system responses.  
4. Evaluate system stability with FXI and Δ.  
5. Extend the model to disease-specific contexts if needed.

## Future Work

- Full simulation engine for immune dynamics  
- Stochastic and time-delayed immune operators  
- Integration with Flexionization Core Framework  
- Visualization tools for FXI/Δ trajectories  
- Machine-learning–based parameter estimation
